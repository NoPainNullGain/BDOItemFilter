# BDOItemFilter

![](bdoItemFilter.gif)
This module is a item filter that when you repair on tent, it removes items you don't want in your inventory, the module will simply drag the items to the trash bin.

It works by grabbing a image of the item you want removed from inventory and placing it in the ItemFilter folder in the bot folder. 
I recommend using ( Windows Key + Shift + S ) to grab a screenshot of the entire inventory slot of the item. 
And paste it into good old paint and save it as a .bmp or .png (other formats might work too, but this is tested) + do not resize the image, it needs to be the same size as ingame image

Try to grab a entire inventory tile of the item, so you see the item Icon with the coloured boarder if its there
